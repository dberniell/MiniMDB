Ruby exercise

Yeah, back to TV shows now. Really, I only think about TV shows. Everything is a TV show. E-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. This is an improvement from Spotinatra, but based on TV shows.

We will have a form in the top, to add TV show & movie names. For example, we will add “Gotham” (new exciting TV show about Batman, began two days ago!), “Masters of Sex” (TV show) and “Garden State” (movie).

Then, we will also have a list that, for each TV show or movie we added to the web application, shows the name, the IMDB rating, the IMDB cover for that and, finally, a link to the IMDB url for that TV show or movie.

Also, each TV show or movie in the list will have a color based on the IMDB rating:

Dark green for those with 9 or above
Green for those with 8 or more, but less than 9
Yellow for those with 5.5 or more, but less than 8
Red for the rest

Hint: yeah, use the IMDB gem :)
